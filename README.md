# Book-recommendation-system
similarity matrices using object oriented program (OOP) concept and building a recommendation engine with python

implementation of similarity metrics for collaborative/content-based recommendation systems. this project focuses on implementing  modules and functions/methods using object oriented programming concepts and Python data science libraries in the recommendation system domain.

# Implementing modules and functions using Object Oriented Programming Concepts
implementing python functions and modules for loading and extracting data from datasets and for computing user similarity and book similarity, using OOP concept

# Ranking of users and books
implements methods. One for finding the first n users with the highest similarity scores to a target user. Here the goal is to find the first n friends of the target user. The target user is the user to be provided with a set of recommendations. This task, in other words, is to find users who have similar tastes or preferences to the current user. Similarly, the second method will return the first n most similar books to the target book.

# Recommendation
implements a method that generates n recommendations for the target user using k nearest neighbours.
